Bind9 LDAP SDB Change Log

bind9-ldap 1.1.1 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  - Call malloc() and free() before we assign a value to the
	    bind{name,pw} variables. I've notice a memory thrashing,
	    maybe this will help...
	  - Fix zone2ldap.c:main() to work with later Bind9.

	Additions/Misc changes
	  - Include zone2ldap command
	  - Include zone2ldif command
	  - Include ldap2zone command
	  - Try connecting three times (with five seconds sleep()
	    between each attempt) to the LDAP server before failing.
	  - More verbose error if failing to connect/bind to the
	    LDAP server (using the ldap_perror() function).
	  - First param to contrib/sdb/ldap/ldapdb.c:ldapdb_bind() is
	    now the zone name. Used only in debug output (makes it
	    easier to figure out which zone that it wasn't possible
	    to bind for).
	  - Add some debugging to easier see connects/binds etc.
