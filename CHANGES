Bind9 LDAP SDB Change Log

bind9-ldap 1.1.1 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  - Call malloc() and free() before we assign a value to the
	    bind{name,pw} variables. I've notice a memory thrashing,
	    maybe this will help...

	Additions/Misc changes
	  - Include zone2ldap command
	  - Include zone2ldif command
	  - Include ldap2zone command
	  - Try connecting five times (with five seconds sleep()
	    between each attempt) to the LDAP server before failing.
	  - More verbose error if failing to connect/bind to the
	    LDAP server (using the ldap_perror() function).
