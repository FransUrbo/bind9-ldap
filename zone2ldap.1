.SH NAME
zone2ldap - Load BIND 9 Zone files into LDAP Directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
zone2ldap [-D Bind DN] [-w Bind Password] [-b Base DN] [-z Zone] [-f Zone File ]
          [[-h LDAP Host]|[-H LDAP URI]] [-cdoZL] [-v] [-O SASL security properties]
          [-Q SASL Quiet mode] [-R SASL realm] [-U Username for SASL bind]
          [-X Authzid for SASL bind] [-Y SASL mechanism] [-I SASL Interactive]
.SH DESCRIPTION
zone2ldap will parse a complete BIND 9 format DNS zone file, and load
the contents into an LDAP directory, for use with the LDAP sdb back-end.

If the zone already exists, zone2ldap will exit succesfully. If the zone does not exists, or 
partially exists, zone2ldap will attempt to add all/missing zone data.

.SS Options
.TP
.BI \-D \ binddn
Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.

If
.B \-o
is specified, it is allowed to specify
.B \-D
multiple times to be able to add multiple DN's with full access in the ACI attribute. See
option
.B \-o
and section
.B LDAP ACI
below.
.TP
.BI \-b \ searchbase
LDAP Base DN. LDAP systems require a "base dn", which is generally considered the LDAP Directory root.
If the zone you are loading is different from the base, then you will need to tell zone2ldap what your LDAP
base is. 
.TP
.BI \-v 
Print version information, and immediatly exit.
.TP
.BI \-f \ file
Zone file.  Bind 9.1 compatible zone file, from which zone information will be read.
.TP
.BI \-d 
Dump debug information to standard out. 
.TP 
.BI \-w \ passwd
LDAP Bind password, corresponding the the value of "-b".
.TP
.BI \-h \ ldaphost
LDAP Directory host. This is the hostname of the LDAP system you wish to store zone information on.
An LDAP server should be listening on port 389 of the target system. Deprecated in favor of -H.
.TP
.BI \-H \ ldapuri
LDAP Directory host. This is the LDAP URI of the LDAP system you wish to store zone information on.
.TP
.BI \-c 
This will create the zone portion of the DN you are importing. For instance, if you are creating a domain.com zone,
zone2ldap should first create "dc=domain,dc=com".  This is useful if you are creating multiple domains.
.TP
.BI \-z 
This is the name of the zone specified in the SOA record.
.TP
.BI \-Z[Z]
Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation.  If  you  use  -ZZ,  the  command  will
require the operation to be successful.
.TP
.BI \-o
Add some very simple OpenLDAPaci attribute(s) to each object created. If a 
.B Bind DN 
(specified with
.B \-D
above) this/those DN(s) will have 
.B full access 
to the object and all of it's child(s).
.TP
.BI \-L
Database creation results are display in LDAP Data Interchange Format detailed in ldif(5) instead
of written to the database. Only one L is supported, and outputs LDIFv1.
.TP
.BI \-O \ security-properties
Specify SASL security properties.
.TP
.BI \-Q
Enable SASL Quiet mode. Never prompt.
.TP
.BI \-R \ realm
Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the realm depends on the actual
SASL mechanism used.
.TP
.BI \-U \ authcid
Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID depends on the actual SASL mechanism
used.
.TP
.BI \-X \ authzid
Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind. authzid must be one of the following formats:
dn:<distinguished name> or u:<username>
.TP
.BI \-Y \ mech
Specify  the  SASL  mechanism  to be used for authentication. If it's not specified, the program will
choose the best mechanism the server knows.
.TP
.BI \-I
Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is to prompt only as needed.
.SH LDAP ACI
If -D is specified more than once, all bind DN's specified will be added to the OpenLDAPaci attribute
with full access:
.LP
.nf
  OpenLDAPaci: 0#entry#grant;r,s,c;objectClass,dc,[entry]#public#
  OpenLDAPaci: 1#entry#grant;w,r,s,c;[all]#access-id#uid=bind9,ou=System,o=Bayour.COM,c=SE
  OpenLDAPaci: 2#entry#grant;w,r,s,c;[all]#access-id#uid=turbo,ou=People,o=Fredriksson,c=SE
.fi
.LP
If
.B no
bind DN's is specified, the attribute will get a '%INSERT_DN_HERE%' access ID which
you will have to replace yourself.
.LP
.nf
  OpenLDAPaci: 0#entry#grant;r,s,c;objectClass,dc,[entry]#public#
  OpenLDAPaci: 1#entry#grant;w,r,s,c;[all]#access-id#%INSERT_DN_HERE%
.fi
.LP
If your database isn't calling the ACI attribute
.B OpenLDAPaci
and the value(s) of this attribute isn't quite what you want, you will have 
to change the code in the
.B add_aci_values()
function located in the
.B zone2ldap.c
file.
.SH EXAMPLES
Following are brief examples of how to import a zone file into your LDAP DIT.
.SS Loading zone domain.com, with an LDAP Base DN of dc=domain,dc=com
zone2ldap -D dc=root -w secret -h localhost -z domain.com -f domain.com.zone 

This will add Resource Records into an ALREADY EXISTING dc=domain,dc=com. The final SOA DN in this case, will be 
dc=@,dc=domain,dc=com

.SS Same example, but with an LDAP URI
zone2ldap -D dc=root -w secret -H ldaps://ldap.domain.tld -z domain.com -f domain.com.zone

.SS Loading customer.com, if your LDAP Base DN is dc=provider,dc=net.
zone2ldap -D dc=root -w secret -h localhost -z customer.com -b dc=provider,dc=net -f customer.com.zone -c

This will create dc=customer,dc=com under dc=provider,dc=net, and add all necessary Resource Records. The final
root DN to the SOA will be dc=@,dc=customer,dc=com,dc=provider,dc=net.

.SS Loading organization.org, if your LDAP Base DN is ou=DNS,o=Organization,c=SE.
.SS Connect using TLS and add ACI records. Fail if TLS was not successfull.
zone2ldap -D dc=root -w secret -h ldap.domain.tld -z organization.org -f organization.org.zone \
  -b ou=DNS,o=Organization,c=SE -c -ZZ -o

.SS Offline generation of the zone objects
zone2ldap -b 'ou=DNS,o=Organization,c=SE' -z organization.org -f organization.org.zone -c -o -L
